                <h3>Chapter One: Football, Gaming </h3>
                
                <p>Like many young lads, I dreamed of becoming a pro football player like Marko Marin. 🏆 Well, you know how life goes, and now I'm working in Venture instead. But hey, Marko and I share something in common—we both switch teams often! Back then, I did my first market analysis and hunted shiny Pokémon cards, leading to a crazy IRR within months (Portfolio can be requested).</p>

                <h3>Chapter Two: Making 10K on the weekends</h3>

                <p>Receiving my first computer after Communion was a game-changer. I spent a staggering 7000 hours playing Counterstrike and FIFA, earning more money than in my first internship at Henkel. 💰 This taught me the value of perseverance and constant learning, as I climbed to the Top 0.1% rank in Germany. However, my academic ambition didn't quite reflect this success, so I decided to pursue my Abitur in business and administration. My style also evolved, shirts and chino pants became my new uniform.👖</p>

                <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
                <p>I was not an easy child. I probably shocked my parents with many things in my youth. One time I tried to build my first startup when I was 17. It was called Loco and was supposed to be the first quick commerce for fashion in 2018. Moving out my parents' house shaped me in life, my favorite anecdote was a house party with 300+ guests at 10 pm, where I learned how guerrilla marketing works and how to handle conflicts with 50+ policemen.</p>
